# Finding Rust variable definition extension (2025-06-22 12:40Z)

_**User**_

Is there a VS Code extension to allow me to right click on a Rust code variable and have an option to jump to the definition like I do with JavaScript TypeScript?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about a VS Code extension for Rust that provides "go to definition" functionality similar to what exists for JavaScript/TypeScript. This is a straightforward question about VS Code extensions for Rust development.

The main VS Code extension for Rust is "rust-analyzer" which provides excellent language server support including go-to-definition, hover information, code completion, etc. This is the de facto standard extension for Rust development in VS Code.

I should provide information about rust-analyzer and how to install/use it, and maybe mention any other relevant extensions.

Since this question is completely unrelated to the codebase (which appears to be a Next.js/TypeScript project based on the context), I don't need to use any tools to search the codebase or analyze it. This is just a general development tools question.</details></think>

Yes! The main VS Code extension for Rust that provides "go to definition" and other language features is **rust-analyzer**.

## rust-analyzer Extension

**Extension ID:** `rust-lang.rust-analyzer`

This extension provides:
- **Go to Definition** (F12 or right-click → "Go to Definition")
- **Go to Type Definition** 
- **Find All References**
- **Peek Definition**
- **Hover information**
- **Code completion**
- **Inline diagnostics**
- **Code formatting**
- **Refactoring tools**

## How to Install:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "rust-analyzer"
4. Install the official one by "The Rust Programming Language Team"

## Alternative Method:
You can also install it via command line:
```bash
code --install-extension rust-lang.rust-analyzer
```

## Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Rust installed on your system:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Usage:
Once installed, you can:
- Right-click on any Rust variable/function → "Go to Definition"
- Use F12 to jump to definition
- Use Ctrl+F12 to go to implementation
- Use Shift+F12 to find all references

The rust-analyzer extension is incredibly powerful and provides IntelliSense-like features that are on par with or even better than what you get with TypeScript!
