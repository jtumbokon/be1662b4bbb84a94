# Duplicate keys in React component (2025-06-13 17:39Z)

_**User**_

Encountered two children with the same key, `link`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.

src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/_components/tools-section.tsx (618:6) @ <unknown>


  616 | 			<div className="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-1">
  617 | 				{tool.keywords.slice(0, 6).map((keyword) => (
> 618 | 					<span
      | 					^
  619 | 						key={keyword}
  620 | 						className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full bg-muted px-2 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground"
  621 | 					>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting Duplicate Keys**

I'm currently focused on the duplicate key error within the React component. Specifically, the issue stems from the `keyword` key, originating from `tool.keywords` in `tools-section.tsx` at line 618. I'm investigating how the `keyword` values might be repeating, given the structure of the data feeding into the component. I plan to check for data duplication during the data mapping.


**Inspecting the Component Code**

I've begun reading the `tools-section.tsx` component to trace the origin of the duplicate `keyword` keys. I'm focusing on line 618 to see how `tool.keywords` is being used and mapped. It appears the mapping process is the source, and now I plan to identify if a transformation is duplicating values prior to assignment of the key.

I see you're getting a duplicate key error in your React component. It looks like the `tool.keywords` array in `src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/_components/tools-section.tsx` might have some duplicate values, which is causing the issue. I'll take a look at the file to confirm and fix it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing the Code Flaw**

I've pinpointed the bug in the `ToolCardContent` component. The `map` function to generate keywords is the culprit. Specifically, the component renders only the first six keywords. I'm currently verifying if the limit of six keywords is the intended behaviour or if it is an oversight.


**Refining the Key Fix**

The problem of the duplicate key issue in the `ToolCardContent` component has been thoroughly examined. I have identified that the core of the issue stems from using potentially non-unique keywords as keys within the `map` function. To address this, I've modified the key generation. I'm now appending the index of the keyword to the keyword itself, forming a unique key. This approach should resolve the React complaints about duplicate keys.


**Finalizing the Key Solution**

I've confirmed the root cause of the duplicate key warning in the `ToolCardContent` component. The flaw arises because the `tool.keywords` array may contain duplicate entries, which are then used as keys within the `map` function. To address this, I've implemented the suggested solution: generating unique keys by combining each keyword with its index in the array using template literals. This strategy provides unique keys and ensures React renders efficiently.

You're right, using `keyword` as a key is causing issues because of duplicates. I'll create a unique key by combining the keyword with its index in the array. I'll apply this fix now.

```diff
  			<CardDescription className="flex-1 line-clamp-3">{tool.description}</CardDescription>
  			<div className="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-1">
- 				{tool.keywords.slice(0, 6).map((keyword) => (
+ 				{tool.keywords.slice(0, 6).map((keyword, index) => (
  					<span
- 						key={keyword}
+ 						key={`${keyword}-${index}`}
  						className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full bg-muted px-2 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground"
  					>
```
