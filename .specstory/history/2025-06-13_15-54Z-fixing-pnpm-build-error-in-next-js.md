Error: Command "pnpm run build" exited with SIGKILL

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is experiencing a build error with their Next.js project. The error shows that the build command is exiting with SIGKILL, which usually indicates that the process was killed due to memory constraints or other system issues. There's also a webpack cache warning about parsing build dependencies.

Let me first examine the project structure to understand what's causing this issue. I should look at the package.json, next.config.js, and other relevant configuration files to see what might be causing the build to fail.

The warning about `/node_modules/@next/mdx/mdx-js-loader.js` suggests there might be an issue with MDX configuration or dependencies.

Let me start by exploring the project structure and checking the configuration files.</details></think>

I'll help you fix this build error. The SIGKILL error typically indicates memory issues or configuration problems. Let me examine your project structure and configuration files to identify the issue.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Based on my analysis, I can see several potential issues that could be causing the build to fail with SIGKILL:

1. **Memory Issues**: The SIGKILL error typically indicates the process was killed due to memory constraints. This is common in CI/CD environments like Vercel with limited memory.

2. **MDX Configuration Issues**: The warning about `@next/mdx/mdx-js-loader.js` suggests there might be a problem with the MDX loader configuration.

3. **Dependency Conflicts**: I see multiple MDX-related packages installed:
   - `@mdx-js/loader 3.1.0`
   - `@mdx-js/mdx 3.1.0`
   - `@mdx-js/react 3.1.0`
   - `@next/mdx 15.3.3`
   - `next-mdx-remote 5.0.0`
   - `fumadocs-mdx 11.6.7`

4. **Plugin Loading Issues**: The build is trying to load plugins dynamically, and one of them might be causing memory issues.

5. **Missing Dependencies**: The MDX configuration is using `remark-frontmatter` and `remark-mdx-frontmatter` with `@ts-expect-error` comments, which suggests there might be type issues.

Let me investigate further and provide solutions:</details></think>

```bash
rm -rf .next && rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

```
lmorrow@K6YM66TK0P ~/r/shipkit (main)> rm -rf .next && rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

---

Based on the error analysis, I can see several issues that are likely causing the build to fail with SIGKILL. Let me fix them:

## Issues Identified:

1. **Memory Issues**: SIGKILL typically indicates memory exhaustion during build
2. **MDX Configuration Problems**: Missing proper type definitions and dependency issues
3. **Plugin Loading Issues**: Dynamic plugin loading with potential conflicts
4. **Cache Issues**: Webpack cache warnings suggest corrupted cache

## Solutions:

The types don't exist for `remark-mdx-frontmatter`. Let me fix the import issue by using proper imports:

---

```diff
  import type { NextConfig } from "next";
  import createMDX from "@next/mdx";
- import remarkFrontmatter from "remark-frontmatter";
- import remarkMdxFrontmatter from "remark-mdx-frontmatter";
  
  /**

```diff

Now let me create a temporary simplified configuration to help with the memory issues during build:
