# Fix build error without disabling library (2025-06-18 16:27Z)

_**User**_

Is there a way to allow imports without the extension?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about an issue with import extensions and they're showing an error about a module not found for 'next/headers'. They specifically mention they don't want to disable anything but fix the specific library issue.

Looking at the error:
```
unhandledRejection [Error: Cannot find module '/Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/node_modules/next/headers' imported from /Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/node_modules/@c15t/nextjs/dist/components/consent-manager-provider/index.js
Did you mean to import "next/headers.js"?] {
  type: 'Error',
  code: 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
  url: 'file:///Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/node_modules/next/headers'
}
```

This is happening with the `@c15t/nextjs` package which is trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, but Next.js (especially in newer versions) requires the extension.

Looking at the web search results, I can see there's discussion about TypeScript file extension handling in Next.js. The search results show that Next.js has specific handling for module resolution and that there are configuration options.

Let me search for more specific information about this error and how to fix it.</details></think>

I'll help you fix this specific library issue. The error is related to the `@c15t/nextjs` package trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is causing module resolution issues.

```

I see you have `@c15t/nextjs` version 1.3.0 installed. This package is trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is causing the module resolution issue. Let me check if there's a fix script in your codebase and investigate the issue further:

---

Read file: scripts/fix-c15t-nextjs.cjs

---

Perfect! You already have a fix script for this exact issue. The problem is that the `@c15t/nextjs` package is using imports without file extensions, which is incompatible with Next.js 15's stricter ESM requirements. Let me run this fix script to patch the package:

---

```bash
node scripts/fix-c15t-nextjs.cjs
```

```

Great! The fix script has successfully patched the `@c15t/nextjs` package. Now let me also check what might be causing the other linter errors in the shipkit-provider file and see if we need to install missing dependencies:

---

```bash
pnpm install
```

```

Now let me run the fix script again to ensure the patch is maintained after the install, and let's also set up a postinstall script to automatically apply this fix:

---

```bash
node scripts/fix-c15t-nextjs.cjs
```

```

The original `next/headers` issue is fixed, but now we have a new issue with CSS module imports. The fix script commented out the CSS imports, but now the default export is missing. Let me update the fix script to handle this properly:

The CSS imports are already patched. Let me examine one of the problematic files to see what's happening:
