<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has shown me an error log that shows an AdapterError occurring in the authentication system. Let me analyze what I can see:

1. There's an AdapterError from Auth.js happening at line 233 in `src/server/auth.ts`
2. The error occurs when trying to call `nextAuthHandlers.GET(req)`
3. The stack trace shows it's happening in a GET handler

This looks like an authentication adapter configuration issue. I should look at the auth configuration to understand what's going wrong. Let me start by examining the auth.ts file to see the current setup.</details></think>

I can see you're getting an `AdapterError` from Auth.js. Let me examine the authentication configuration to understand what's causing this issue.

---

Read file: src/server/auth.ts

---

Now let me check the beginning of the file to see how the Auth.js configuration is set up:

---

Read file: src/server/auth.ts

---

Now let me check the auth configuration and see if there are any issues with the adapter setup:

---

Read file: src/server/auth.config.ts

---

Let me also check the auth providers configuration to see if there might be any issues there:

---

Could not find file 'src/server/auth-providers' in the workspace.

---

Read file: src/server/auth-providers.ts

---

Now let me check the environment variables to see what auth providers are enabled:

---

Could not find file '.env.local' in the workspace.

---

Could not find file .env.example in the workspace.

---

Could not find file 'src/env.js' in the workspace.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'teamMembers' does not exist in type '{ accounts?: true | DBQueryConfig<"many", false, ExtractTablesWithRelations<typeof import("/Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/src/server/db/schema")>, { tsName: "accounts"; dbName: "account"; columns: { ...; }; relations: { ...; }; primaryKey: AnyColumn[]; }> | undefined; files?: true | ... 1 more ... | undefined; }'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error, it seems like there's an issue with the database schema relations. The error is saying that 'teamMembers' does not exist in the type for the `with` clause when querying users.

Let me look at the code:

```typescript
return db.query.users.findFirst({
    where: eq(users.id, userId),
    with: {
        teamMembers: {
            with: {
                team: true,
            },
        },
        projectMembers: {
            with: {
                project: {
                    with: {
                        team: true,
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```

The error suggests that the `users` table doesn't have a `teamMembers` relation defined in the schema. I need to check the database schema to see how the relations are set up.

Looking at the imports, I can see:
```typescript
import { projectMembers, teamMembers, userFiles, users } from "@/server/db/schema";
```

The issue is likely that the `users` table in the schema doesn't have the proper relations defined for `teamMembers` and `projectMembers`. Let me check the schema file to understand the current relations.

Actually, let me think about this differently. The error shows that the available relations for users are `accounts` and `files`. So it seems like the `users` table only has relations to `accounts` and `files` (which could be `userFiles`), but not to `teamMembers` or `projectMembers`.

This suggests that the schema relations are not properly set up. In Drizzle ORM, you need to define relations on both sides of the relationship.

Since the user is asking for a concise fix, I should check the schema file first to see what relations are defined, then suggest how to fix it.</details></think>

Looking at the error, the `users` table doesn't have the `teamMembers` relation defined in the schema. Let me check the database schema to see the current relations:

---

Read file: src/server/db/schema.ts

---

Now let me check for the teamMembers and projectMembers relations:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "teamMembers.*relations" â€¢ **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/src/server/db/schema.ts` | L270 | `export const teamMembersRelations = relations(teamMembers, ({ one }) => ({` |

</details>

---

Read file: src/server/db/schema.ts

---

Perfect! I can see the issue. The `usersRelations` on line 144-147 is missing the `teamMembers` and `projectMembers` relations. Here's the concise fix:

---



---

That should resolve the TypeScript error. The `users` table now has the proper relations defined for both `teamMembers` and `projectMembers`, which will allow the `with` clause in your query to work correctly.
