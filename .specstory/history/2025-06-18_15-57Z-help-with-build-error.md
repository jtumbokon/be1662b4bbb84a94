help with this error during build

DON"T DISABLE IT, FIX IT

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting an error during build that says:

```
unhandledRejection [Error: Cannot find module '/Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/node_modules/next/headers' imported from /Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/node_modules/@c15t/nextjs/dist/components/consent-manager-provider/index.js
Did you mean to import "next/headers.js"?] {
  type: 'Error',
  code: 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
  url: 'file:///Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit/node_modules/next/headers'
}
```

This error indicates that there's a module resolution issue with the `@c15t/nextjs` package trying to import `next/headers`. The error suggests that it should be importing `next/headers.js` instead.

This is likely related to ES modules and how Node.js resolves module paths. Let me first check the current state of the project to understand what's happening.

Let me look at:
1. The package.json to see what dependencies are installed
2. The next.config.ts to see the configuration
3. Check if there are any issues with the @c15t/nextjs package

First, I'll search for any usage of @c15t/nextjs in the codebase and check the package.json.</details></think>

---

I can see this is a module resolution error with the `@c15t/nextjs` package trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension. This is a common issue with ES modules in Node.js where the file extension is required.

Let me investigate the current setup and fix this issue.

---

Read file: package.json

---

Read file: next.config.ts

---

Now let me check the consent provider file that's using `@c15t/nextjs`:

---

Read file: src/components/providers/consent-provider.tsx

---

The issue is that the `@c15t/nextjs` package is trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is required in ES modules. Since the project has `"type": "module"` in package.json, Node.js requires explicit file extensions for imports.

Let me check if there's a newer version available or if there's a way to configure this:

---

```bash
pnpm info @c15t/nextjs versions --json
```

```
npm warn Unknown project config "shamefully-hoist". This will stop working in th
e next major version of npm.
npm warn Unknown project config "enable-pre-post-scripts". This will stop workin

Now let me check the changelog or issues on the package to understand this ES module issue. The error is happening because the package is trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is required in ES modules.

Let me also check what version of Next.js we're using and see if there's a compatibility issue:

---

```bash
pnpm list next
```

```
lmorrow@K6YM66TK0P ~/r/shipkit (main)> pnpm list next
Legend: production dependency, optional only, dev only

ship-kit@0.2.0 /Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit (PRIVATE)

dependencies:

lmorrow@K6YM66TK0P ~/r/shipkit (main)>
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>So we have Next.js 15.3.3 and @c15t/nextjs 1.3.0. The issue is that the @c15t/nextjs package is trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is required in ES modules.

Let me check if there's a way to configure this in the Next.js config or if I need to modify the webpack configuration to handle this. 

First, let me check if there are any known issues or solutions for this. The error message suggests the module should import `next/headers.js` instead.

This is a common issue with ES modules where explicit file extensions are required. Let me look at the webpack configuration in next.config.ts to see if we can add a resolve configuration to handle this.</details></think>

The issue is that `@c15t/nextjs` is trying to import `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is required when using ES modules (you have `"type": "module"` in package.json).

Let me check if we can configure webpack in `next.config.ts` to resolve this:

---

Read file: next.config.ts

---

Now I need to fix the webpack configuration to handle the ES module resolution issue. The problem is that `@c15t/nextjs` is importing `next/headers` without the `.js` extension. I'll add a webpack resolve configuration to handle this:

Now let's test if this fixes the build error by running a build:

---

```bash
pnpm build

The webpack alias approach didn't work. This is happening during runtime after the build, not during the webpack compilation. The issue is that `@c15t/nextjs` is importing `next/headers` without the `.js` extension, which is required in ES modules.

Let me try a different approach. Let me check if we can downgrade the package to use CommonJS instead of ES modules, or configure Node.js to handle this better:

---

Let me test if removing the ES module type fixes the issue:

pnpm build

Let me check what exactly is in the @c15t/nextjs module to understand the import issue better:

---

```bash
cat node_modules/@c15t/nextjs/dist/components/consent-manager-provider/index.js | head -20
```

```
lmorrow@K6YM66TK0P ~/r/shipkit (main) [1]> cat node_modules/@c15t/nextjs/dist/components/consent-manager-pro

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The output is minified but I can see that it's importing from `next/headers` (`import*as t from"next/headers"`). This is the issue - it's importing without the `.js` extension.

Let me try a different approach - using a patch-package to fix this import, or trying to use a postinstall script to fix the import.

First, let me check if there's a newer version or canary version that might fix this, or if I can create a patch.</details></think>

I can see the minified code is importing `next/headers` without the `.js` extension. Let me try installing the latest canary version that might have this fixed:

```bash
pnpm add @c15t/nextjs@latest
