# Import error for fileTypeFromFile (2025-06-12 20:39Z)

_**User**_

When did we start using edge?
Export fileTypeFromFile doesn't exist in target module

./node_modules/payload/dist/uploads/endpoints/getFile.js (2:1)

Export fileTypeFromFile doesn't exist in target module
  1 | // @ts-strict-ignore
> 2 | import { fileTypeFromFile } from 'file-type';
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  3 | import fsPromises from 'fs/promises';
  4 | import { status as httpStatus } from 'http-status';
  5 | import path from 'path';

The export fileTypeFromFile was not found in module [project]/node_modules/file-type/core.js [middleware-edge] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import fileTypeFromBlob?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
