Perfect! Now I understand the situation. Commit 28d2426 added the Stack Auth integration, and there have been many commits since then. Let me help you revert to that commit and then reapply the changes incrementally.

First, let me create a backup branch of the current state:

---

```bash
git branch backup-before-revert
```

```
lmorrow@K6YM66TK0P ~/r/shipkit (fixin)> git branch backup-before-revert
```

---

Now let's reset to commit 28d2426:

---

```bash
git reset --hard 28d2426
```

```
lmorrow@K6YM66TK0P ~/r/shipkit (fixin)> git reset --hard 28d2426

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to make the changes from commit 28d2426 one at a time so they can QA each change. Let me look at what files were changed in that commit and apply them incrementally.

From the git show --stat output, I can see these files were changed:
- ai.mdx (modified)
- docs/STACK_AUTH_INTEGRATION.md (new file)
- middleware.ts (new file)
- src/app/(app)/(authentication)/_components/oauth-buttons.tsx (modified)

- src/server/services/stack-auth-service.ts (new file)
- src/server/services/user-service.ts (modified)
- src/server/stack-auth.config.ts (new file)

I should start with the foundational changes first - environment variables, configuration, then move to auth providers, then the UI components.

But wait, I need to first go back to the commit BEFORE 28d2426 so I can apply the changes from that commit one by one.</details></think>

You're right! Let me go back to the commit right before 28d2426 and then apply the changes from that commit one at a time. First, let me find the parent commit:

---

```bash
cd /Users/lmorrow/repo/shipkit && git log --oneline -5 28d2426

Now let me reset to the commit before 28d2426 (which is 3e5380b) and then apply the changes incrementally:

```bash
git reset --hard 3e5380b

Perfect! Now let me look at the exact changes that were made in commit 28d2426 and apply them one by one. Let me start with the first change - the environment variables:

---

```bash

I should start with the foundational changes first - environment variables, configuration, then move to auth providers, then the UI components.

But wait, I need to first go back to the commit BEFORE 28d2426 so I can apply the changes from that commit one by one.</details></think>

Now let me add the Stack Auth feature flag to the runtime environment:

Perfect! Now let's test this first change by checking if the build still works:

---

```bash
pnpm run build --verbose 2>&1 | head -50
