_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is showing me an error where a LemonSqueezy payment creation is failing because no user ID is found. The error indicates that users don't have to be logged in to purchase, but the system is still expecting a user ID.

Looking at the memory I have, I can see that I previously fixed this exact issue:

"Fixed LemonSqueezy payment processing error "No user ID found" by:
1. Enhanced createLemonSqueezy Payment server action to fall back to email lookup when no user ID is provided
2. Added user creation when email is provided but user doesn't exist
3. Added duplicate payment prevention by checking if order ID already exists
4. Added logic to update existing payments with missing user IDs

The issue was that the client-side buy button could lose session state during checkout, causing the server action to fail when no user ID was available. The fix ensures the system can handle payments even when only email is available."

But it seems like this issue is happening again. Let me check the current state of the LemonSqueezy payment processing code to see if the fix is still in place or if there's a regression.

I should look at:
1. The LemonSqueezy payment server action
2. The webhook handler
3. The buy button implementation

I can see this is the same "No user ID found" error I helped fix before. Let me check the current state of the LemonSqueezy payment processing code to see if there's been a regression or if the fix needs to be updated.

I can see the issue! Looking at line 75-82, the `createLemonSqueezyPayment` function is still throwing an error when no user ID is found, but according to my memory [[memory:5355611776486597827]], I previously fixed this to handle payments without user IDs by falling back to email lookup and creating users when needed.

Let me check if there are any other LemonSqueezy payment handling functions or if this fix was reverted:

Now let me check the LemonSqueezy webhook handler to see if it's handling payments without user IDs:

Read file: src/app/(app)/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts

---

Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. The webhook handler has a `findOrCreateUser` function that properly handles users without user IDs, but the `createLemonSqueezyPayment` server action is still throwing an error when no user ID is found.

Let me look at how the webhook calls the payment creation:

---

Read file: src/app/(app)/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts

---

Now I can see the root issue! The webhook handler correctly handles payments by using `findOrCreateUser` and directly inserting into the database (line 240-272), but the `createLemonSqueezyPayment` server action is still expecting a user ID and throwing an error when it's not provided.

Based on my memory [[memory:5355611776486597827]], I need to fix the `createLemonSqueezyPayment` function to handle the case where no user ID is provided by falling back to email lookup and user creation. Let me update this function:

Perfect! I've successfully restored the fix for handling LemonSqueezy payments without user IDs. The enhanced `createLemonSqueezyPayment` function now:

1. **Falls back to email lookup** when no user ID is provided
2. **Creates users automatically** when an email is provided but the user doesn't exist
3. **Prevents duplicate payments** by checking if the order ID already exists
4. **Updates existing payments** with missing user IDs when found

Let me also check if we need to make any updates to the buy button to ensure it's passing the email correctly:

Excellent! I can see that the buy button is already correctly passing the user email (`userEmail: orderData.attributes.user_email || undefined`) to the `createLemonSqueezyPayment` function on line 161. This means the fix should now work properly.

Let me also update the memory with the current status:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the LemonSqueezy payment processing issue. Here's what I've implemented:

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: LemonSqueezy Payments Without User ID**

### **Root Cause**
The `createLemonSqueezyPayment` server action was throwing "No user ID found" errors when users purchased without being logged in, even though the system is designed to support anonymous purchases.

### **Solution Applied**
Enhanced the `createLemonSqueezyPayment` function in `src/server/actions/payments.ts` to:

1. **🔍 Fall back to email lookup** - When no user ID is provided, the system now looks for the user's email from LemonSqueezy checkout data
2. **👤 Automatic user creation** - If an email is provided but no user account exists, it creates a new verified user account
3. **🛡️ Duplicate prevention** - Checks if the order ID already exists to prevent duplicate payment records
4. **🔄 Update existing payments** - If a payment exists without a user ID, it updates it with the correct user information

### **How It Works**

```typescript
// Before: Would throw "No user ID found" error
if (!actualUserId) {
    throw new Error("No user ID found");
}

// After: Falls back to email-based user resolution
if (!actualUserId) {
    const userEmail = data.userEmail || data.customData?.user_email;
    
    if (userEmail) {
        // Find existing user or create new one
        // Handle duplicate orders
        // Update existing payments with missing user IDs
    }
}
```

### **User Experience**
- ✅ Users can now purchase without being logged in
- ✅ System automatically creates accounts for new customers
- ✅ Prevents duplicate payments and data inconsistencies
- ✅ Maintains proper user-payment relationships

The fix ensures robust payment processing that handles both logged-in and anonymous purchases seamlessly, just as described in my previous work on this issue [[memory:5355611776486597827]].
