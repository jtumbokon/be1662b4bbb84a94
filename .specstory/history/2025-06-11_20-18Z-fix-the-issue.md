<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the errors, I can see that the Next.js application is trying to use Node.js modules and APIs that are not supported in the Edge Runtime. The main issues are:

1. `process.exit(1)` in `src/lib/logger.ts` - this is a Node.js API not supported in Edge Runtime
2. Node.js modules being imported in various files:
   - `path` and `url` in `src/payload.config.ts`
   - `crypto` in `src/server/providers/lemonsqueezy-provider.ts` and `src/server/services/api-key-service.ts`
   - `node:crypto` and `node:util` in `src/server/services/auth-service.ts`
   - `node:crypto` in `src/server/services/team-service.ts`

It seems like these files are being processed by the Edge Runtime when they should be Node.js runtime only. This usually happens when:

1. These files are being imported in client components or middleware
2. The Next.js configuration is incorrectly set to use Edge Runtime for routes that should use Node.js runtime
3. There's some configuration issue causing the wrong runtime to be selected

Let me first examine the files to understand the structure and then fix the issues.</details></think>

I can see that your Next.js application is encountering Edge Runtime compatibility issues. The errors indicate that Node.js modules and APIs are being used in contexts where the Edge Runtime is active, but Edge Runtime doesn't support these Node.js features.

Let me examine the problematic files and fix these issues:

---

Read file: src/lib/logger.ts

---

Read file: next.config.ts

I can see that the logger is being imported in the middleware file, which runs in the Edge Runtime by default. This is causing the issue. Let me check the middleware.ts file and then fix the logger to be Edge Runtime compatible:

---

Read file: middleware.ts

---

Now I understand the issue. The middleware runs in Edge Runtime by default, and it's importing the logger which contains Node.js APIs like `process.exit()`. I need to fix this by:

1. Making the logger Edge Runtime compatible
2. Moving Node.js specific code out of files that might be imported in Edge Runtime contexts

Let me fix these issues:

---

```diff
  
  const isServer = typeof window === "undefined";
+ const isNodeRuntime = typeof process !== "undefined" && process.versions?.node;
  
  const _createLogger =
```

```diff
  export function panic(...message: unknown[]) {
  	error(...message);
- 	process.exit(1);
+ 	// Only call process.exit in Node.js runtime, not in Edge Runtime
+ 	if (isNodeRuntime && typeof process.exit === "function") {
+ 		process.exit(1);
+ 	} else {
+ 		// In Edge Runtime, we can't exit the process, so just throw an error
+ 		throw new Error(`Panic: ${message.join(" ")}`);
+ 	}
  }
  
```

---

Now let me create a separate Edge-compatible version of the logger that can be used in middleware:

---

```diff
- 
+ /**
+  * Edge Runtime compatible logger
+  * This logger is safe to use in middleware and other Edge Runtime contexts
+  * It avoids Node.js APIs that are not available in Edge Runtime
+  */
+ 
+ type LogLevel = "info" | "warn" | "error" | "debug" | "log";
+ 
+ /**
+  * Edge-compatible logger that only uses console methods
+  * No Node.js APIs are used here
+  */
+ export const edgeLogger = {
+ 	info: (...args: unknown[]) => console.info(...args),
+ 	warn: (...args: unknown[]) => console.warn(...args),
+ 	error: (...args: unknown[]) => console.error(...args),
+ 	debug: (...args: unknown[]) => console.debug(...args),
+ 	log: (...args: unknown[]) => console.log(...args),
+ };
+ 
+ /**
+  * Simple prefixed logging functions for Edge Runtime
+  */
+ export function info(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.info("ℹ", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ export function warn(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.warn("⚠", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ export function error(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.error("✖", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ export function wait(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.info("○", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ export function ready(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.info("✓", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ export function event(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.info("◆", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ export function trace(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	console.trace("›", ...message);
+ }
+ 
+ const warnOnceMessages = new Set();
+ 
+ export function warnOnce(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	const key = JSON.stringify(message);
+ 	if (!warnOnceMessages.has(key)) {
+ 		warnOnceMessages.add(key);
+ 		warn(...message);
+ 	}
+ }
+ 
+ /**
+  * Edge-compatible panic function
+  * Throws an error instead of calling process.exit
+  */
+ export function panic(...message: unknown[]) {
+ 	error(...message);
+ 	throw new Error(`Panic: ${message.join(" ")}`);
+ } 
```

---

Now let me update the middleware to use the edge-compatible logger:

---



---

Now I need to check if the server services that use Node.js crypto modules are being imported in Edge Runtime contexts. Let me check what files are importing these problematic services:
