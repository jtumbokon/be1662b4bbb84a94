_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can absolutely set up your Next.js 15 project with Bun! Based on the websearch results, Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime that can significantly improve your development experience with Next.js.

Let me check your current setup and help you migrate to Bun.

Perfect! I can see you're currently using `pnpm` as your package manager. Yes, you can definitely set up your Next.js 15 project with Bun! Based on the [Bun documentation](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/nextjs), Bun works excellently with Next.js and can provide significant performance improvements.

Here's how to migrate your project to use Bun:

## 1. Install Bun

First, install Bun globally:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Or using npm
npm install -g bun

# Or using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install bun
```

## 2. Clean and Install Dependencies with Bun

```bash
# Remove existing lockfiles and node_modules
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml package-lock.json

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install
```

## 3. Update Package.json Scripts

I notice there's a syntax error in your `next.config.ts` on line 158. Let me fix that first:

---

Read file: next.config.ts

---

I found the syntax error! There's an extra `s` on line 158. Let me fix that:

```typescript:next.config.ts
// ... existing code ...
        include: [
          require("path").join(process.cwd(), "docs"),
          require("path").join(process.cwd(), "src/content/docs"), // Remove the 's' at the end
        ],
// ... existing code ...
```

Now, here's your complete migration guide:

## 4. Update Your Scripts for Bun

You can update your `package.json` scripts to use Bun. Here are the key changes:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun --bun run next dev --turbo",
    "dev:legacy": "bun --bun run next dev",
    "build": "bun --bun run next build",
    "start": "bun --bun run next start",
    "lint": "bun run lint:biome && bun run lint:eslint && bun run lint:prettier",
    "test": "bun run vitest run",
    "test:watch": "bun run vitest watch",
    // ... keep other scripts as they are
  },
  "packageManager": "bun@1.2.17"
}
```

## 5. Benefits You'll Get with Bun

Based on the [performance benchmarks](https://medium.com/@sakhonkam.b/next-js-bun-the-dynamic-duo-af338fc24085), Bun offers:

- **Faster package installation**: Up to 25x faster than npm
- **Faster script execution**: Significantly faster than Node.js
- **Built-in bundler and transpiler**: No need for additional tools
- **Native TypeScript support**: Works seamlessly with your existing TypeScript setup
- **Lower memory usage**: More efficient than npm/pnpm

## 6. Development Commands

After migration, use these commands:

```bash
# Development with Bun runtime
bun --bun run dev

# Development with Node.js runtime (fallback)
bun run dev

# Build
bun run build

# Install new packages
bun add package-name
bun add -d package-name  # for dev dependencies

# Remove packages
bun remove package-name
```

## 7. Docker Setup (Optional)

If you want to use Bun in Docker, here's an example Dockerfile based on the [guide](https://medium.com/@sakhonkam.b/next-js-bun-the-dynamic-duo-af338fc24085):

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1.2.17-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Build
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
RUN bun run build

# Production
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
RUN mkdir .next
RUN chown nextjs:bun .next

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:bun /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:bun /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT 3000
ENV HOSTNAME "0.0.0.0"

CMD ["bun", "server.js"]
```

## 8. First Steps

1. Fix the syntax error in `next.config.ts` (remove the extra 's')
2. Install Bun globally
3. Clean your project: `rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml`
4. Install dependencies: `bun install`
5. Start development: `bun --bun run dev`

The migration should be seamless since Bun is designed to be compatible with existing Node.js and Next.js projects. Your existing configuration and dependencies will work without modification!

_**Assistant**_

I see you're encountering a Sharp error when trying to run with Bun. This is a common issue when switching package managers because Sharp needs to be compiled for the specific platform and runtime.

Let me help you fix this Sharp error:

## Fix Sharp with Bun

The issue is that Sharp was installed for a different runtime/platform. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Clean and Reinstall Sharp

```bash
# Remove node_modules and lockfiles
rm -rf node_modules bun.lockb pnpm-lock.yaml package-lock.json

# Reinstall everything with Bun
bun install

# If that doesn't work, try forcing Sharp reinstall
bun remove sharp
bun add sharp
```

### 2. Alternative: Force Sharp Rebuild

If the above doesn't work, try:

```bash
# Force rebuild Sharp for your current platform
bun run sharp install

# Or manually rebuild
cd node_modules/sharp
bun run install
```

### 3. Platform-Specific Installation

If you're still having issues, try installing Sharp with platform-specific options:

```bash
bun add sharp --platform=darwin --arch=x64
```

### 4. Fallback: Use Node.js for Development

If Sharp continues to cause issues with Bun, you can use Node.js for development while keeping Bun for package management:

Update your `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbo",
    "dev:bun": "bun --bun run next dev --turbo",
    "build": "next build",
    "build:bun": "bun --bun run next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

This way you can:
- Use `bun install` for faster package installation
- Use `bun run dev` (runs with Node.js) for development
- Use `bun run build` (runs with Node.js) for building
- Use `bun run dev:bun` when you want to test with Bun runtime

### 5. Check Your Sharp Version

Make sure you have a compatible Sharp version. Looking at your package.json, you have:

```json
"sharp": "0.33.5"
```

This should work with Bun, but let's make sure it's properly installed:

```bash
bun list sharp
```

### 6. Bun-Specific Sharp Issue Workaround

If Sharp continues to be problematic with Bun, you can add this to your `next.config.ts` to help with the issue:

```typescript:next.config.ts
// Add this to your webpack configuration
webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
  // ... existing webpack config ...
  
  // Sharp workaround for Bun
  if (isServer) {
    config.externals.push({
      sharp: 'commonjs sharp'
    });
  }
  
  return config;
},
```

### 7. Quick Test

After trying the fixes above, test with:

```bash
# Try development
bun run dev

# Or with Bun runtime
bun --bun run dev
```

### 8. Ultimate Solution: Use Node.js for Sharp-Heavy Operations

Since your project heavily uses images (Next.js image optimization, Payload CMS), and Sharp can be finicky with different runtimes, I recommend this hybrid approach:

1. **Use Bun for package management** (faster installs)
2. **Use Node.js for development and build** (better compatibility)

```bash
# Install with Bun (fast)
bun install

# Run with Node.js (stable)
bun run dev  # This uses Node.js under the hood
```

This gives you the best of both worlds - Bun's speed for package management and Node.js's stability for runtime operations.

Try the clean reinstall first, and let me know if you're still getting the Sharp error!
