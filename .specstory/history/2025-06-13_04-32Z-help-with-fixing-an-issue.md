# Help with fixing an issue (2025-06-13 04:32Z)

Help me fix this.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to help fix an issue. Looking at the linter errors, I can see the problem is in the `getUserWithAssociations` method in `src/server/services/user-service.ts`. The error is:

```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'teamMemberships' does not exist in type ...
```

This suggests that the database schema query is trying to use a relation called `teamMemberships` that doesn't exist in the users table schema. Looking at the code, I can see that the method is trying to query:

```typescript
with: {
    teamMemberships: {
        with: {
            team: true,
        },
    },
    projectMemberships: {
        with: {
            project: {
                with: {
                    team: true,
                },
            },
        },
    },
},
```

But based on the linter error and the database schema imports I can see at the top of the file (`projectMembers, teamMembers, userFiles, users`), it looks like the correct relation names should probably be different.

Let me look at what relations are available. The error message mentions that the available properties include `accounts` and `files`, which suggests these are the actual relation names defined in the schema.

Looking at other methods in the same file, I can see patterns like:
- `db.query.teamMembers.findMany({ where: eq(teamMembers.userId, userId), ...})`
- `db.query.projectMembers.findMany({ where: eq(projectMembers.userId, userId), ...})`

This suggests that instead of trying to query relations directly on the users table, I should probably be querying the junction tables (teamMembers and projectMembers) and including the user data there.

However, if the users table does have relations defined, they might be named differently. Common naming patterns would be:
- `teamMembers` (for the junction table records)


- `projectMembers` (for the junction table records)

I'll investigate the database schema to confirm the correct relation names and understand how to properly structure the query.</details></think>

I can see the issue here. The linter error indicates that `teamMemberships` and `projectMemberships` don't exist as relations on the `users` table in your database schema. Let me first check the schema to understand the correct relation names.

Read file: src/server/db/schema.ts

Perfect! I can see the issue now. Looking at line 122-126, I can see the correct relation names in the `usersRelations`:

```typescript
export const usersRelations = relations(users, ({ many }) => ({
	accounts: many(accounts),
	files: many(userFiles),
	teamMembers: many(teamMembers),
	projectMembers: many(projectMembers),
}));
```

The relations are named `teamMembers` and `projectMembers`, not `teamMemberships` and `projectMemberships`. Let me fix this:

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. The problem was that the method was trying to use relation names `teamMemberships` and `projectMemberships` that don't exist in the database schema. Looking at the schema file, I found that the correct relation names are:

- `teamMembers` (not `teamMemberships`)
- `projectMembers` (not `projectMemberships`)

These are defined in the `usersRelations` in the schema:

```175:194:src/server/services/user-service.ts
		return db.query.users.findFirst({
			where: eq(users.id, userId),
			with: {
				teamMembers: {
					with: {
						team: true,
					},
				},
				projectMembers: {
					with: {
						project: {
							with: {
								team: true,
							},
						},
					},
				},
			},
		});
	}
```

The linter error should now be resolved! The method will correctly query the user with their associated team memberships and project memberships through the proper relation names defined in your database schema.
